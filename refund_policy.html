Tickets are not transferable; if you must drop out, we want to be able to extend your ticket to the next person "on the wait list." In the unfortunate event that you can't use your ticket, please contact register @ashevillecontra.com right away.


Refunds: If your registration has been processed and confirmed, your ticket will be refunded up until May 31, less a $20 administrative fee. After that, there are no refunds. Travel insurance is advised.
